# 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my DSA repository! 🚀  
This repository contains solutions to a wide range of **Data Structures and Algorithms** problems, written in C++ (and other languages where applicable). It is aimed at helping others practice, revise, and master DSA concepts for coding interviews, competitive programming, and academic preparation.
